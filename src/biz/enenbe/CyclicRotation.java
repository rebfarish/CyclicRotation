/**
 * An array A consisting of N integers is given. Rotation of the array means that each element is
 * shifted right by one index, and the last element of the array is moved to the first place. For
 * example, the rotation of array A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] is [6, 3, 8, 9, 7] (elements are shifted right
 * by one index and 6 is moved to the first place).
 *
 * The goal is to rotate array A K times; that is, each element of A will be shifted to the right K
 * times.
 *
 * Write a function:
 *
 * class Solution { public int[] solution(int[] A, int K); }
 *
 * that, given an array A consisting of N integers and an integer K, returns the array A rotated K
 * times.
 *
 * For example, given A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] K = 3
 *
 * the function should return [9, 7, 6, 3, 8]. Three rotations were made: [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] -> [6, 3,
 * 8, 9, 7] [6, 3, 8, 9, 7] -> [7, 6, 3, 8, 9] [7, 6, 3, 8, 9] -> [9, 7, 6, 3, 8]
 *
 * Assume that:
 *
 * N and K are integers within the range [0..100]; each element of array A is an integer within the
 * range [âˆ’1,000..1,000].
